<h2>Testing and Debugging</h2>
<h4>The Importance of Testing and Debugging</h4>
<p>JavaScript is a fairly forgiving language when it comes to errors; it didnâ€™t implement exceptions at all until ECMAScript version 3. Instead of alerting a user to an error in a program, it just failed silently in the background, and this is sometimes still the case. It might seem like a good idea at first, but the error might give unexpected or incorrect results that nobody spots, or lurk in the background for a long time before causing the program to crash spectacularly. Failing silently makes errors difficult to spot and longer to track down.</p>
<h4>Strict Mode</h4>
<p>strict mode that produces more exceptions and warnings and prohibits the use of some deprecated features. This is due to the fact that strict mode considers coding practices that were previously accepted as just being 'poor style' as actual errors.</p>
<h4>Detect browsers</h4>
<p>window.navigator.userAgent can be used to detect the browser</p>
<h4>Error Object</h4>
<p>const error = new Error('Oops, something went wrong');</p>
